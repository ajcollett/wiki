# Final Steps
Final steps that should be completed to have a fully functional RADIUSDesk WiFi hot-spot.

## Passwords should be changed
There are a number of passwords that should be changed before we can make this hot-spot publicly accessible.

1. The *sudo* password of the Raspberry Pi should be changed. Currectly it is `raspberry`, with the only user being `pi`. This is as per the default setup for Raspbian.
  * Login to the pi via __ssh__ or __tty__.
  * Type `passwd`
  * Follow the prompts (default pass is `raspberry`)
2. The RADIUSDesk password __*TODO*__
3. __*TODO*__ Possibly others?

## Add details to RADIUSDesk
This section is not very exhaustive. There is much info on the main RADIUSDesk site, and a few videos too.
