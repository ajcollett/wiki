# RADIUSDesk on Raspberry Pi 3
## Setup

* We will be using a Raspberry pi 3 for this. [This](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b/)

* The Ethernet port will be setup to be the `www`, the point where we connect the Pi to the internet.

* The Wifi will be setup as a wifi network, RPI3 by default

* None of the default settings will be changed, but I will try point out the things that should. Like the raspberry pi root password.
